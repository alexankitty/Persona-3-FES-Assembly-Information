# Persona-3-FES-Assembly-Information
This repository will contain every part of my research of Persona 3 FES' assembly/machine code/elf. There can and will be inaccuracies. This will be a mess.

# Contributing
Open a PR with some notes to add and I'll add them. Or if you want to help me organize fee lfree.

# Purpose
The point of this repository is to catalog as much information about the game's assembly to make it easier for developers to get their mods off the ground. Or if decomp ever happens to provide as much information to assist with that.
